Skye Aston is available for download on the Sims 4 gallery (I would put a link, but I think EA likes to break/change those, so just search her name). I made a CC version that has her arm bandage & a noCC version that doesn't have that (or any other CC, obviously?). So if you want the "full" version of her, make sure you have "include custom content" checked. Her household description is:

> Skye nearly lost her left arm, then lost her brother, & now wants to start a farm in the countryside. She always wears his dog tags and the bandages that make it possible to use her disabled arm. But will her independent loner nature clash with Henford-on-Bagley's close-knit community? - - Only CC is arm bandage - https://nell-le.tumblr.com/post/189508187539/bandage-set-hq-compatible-base-game-compatible #cottageliving #cottage #living #woman #single #farm #starter

Not totally sure why on the dog tags or the arm, it just popped in my head that way. Something like: "Give her dog tags." *Why?* "Just do it" *Ok.....* "Those are her brother's dog tags, he died while serving in the military" *What?* "Ok I'm done, continue what you were doing" *Anything else you wanna share?* "Nope!" - was about how it went.

I decided she would live in Finchwick village, at least for now. Using her savings (aka starter funds), she bought 5 Cobblebottom Street (accross from the bar), with the lot challenges: wild foxes & simple living.

First order of business: I bought a baby hen chick & named her Hannah.

So cute!

Next we got some plants going, oversized lectuce and some stuff from some seed packs.

The bar owner & her husband were the whole welcome wagon.

I started getting her out to meet everyone & get started on doing favors.

The creature keeper actually came to me, before I even had the chance to go visit him (also totally don't have the stuff to cook yet, so totally making due with favor rewards & fruitcake to start this off).

Yes, free stuff.

I really think this snail thing is just too cute.

Alright birds, *speak* to me.

I managed to score some stuff to expand her garden

And Hannah grew up!

I discovered that I can sale nightly mushrooms to the creature keeper for a significant markup, so he became a rather regular guest at the house.

Hannah is a regular (non-golden) hen, but Skye takes really good care of her (pretty easy with just 1 animal and not that many plants on the lot), so she lays golden eggs sometimes. So getting all of Skye's current plants to prefect was pretty easy. This really increased how much she gets for her nightly mushrooms.

So we've secured a really good source of income & made some upgrades to teh garden & house itself. Honestly I couldn't play for that long, I had to go to work, but it feels like I got her started on the right foot to get things all setup.

Here's the house so far:

Oh yeah: this is Robbin, our resident wild fox. I think his outfit was a reward from an errand? Either way it's cute & funny.
